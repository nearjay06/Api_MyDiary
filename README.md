[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nearjay06/Api_MyDiary.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nearjay06/Api_MyDiary)

1.On Pivotal Tracker, create user stories to setup and test API endpoints that do the following using data structures
-Get all diary entries.
-Get a specific diary entry.
-Add an entry
-Modify an entry.

2.Version your API using url versioning starting, with the letter “v”. A simple ordinal number would be appropriate and avoid dot notation such as 2.5. An example of this will be : https://somewebapp.com/api/v1/users.

3.Using separate branches for each feature, create version 1 (v1) of your RESTful API to power front-end pages

4.Write tests for the API endpoints
Ensure to test all endpoints and see that they work using Postman.
5.Integrate TravisCI for Continuous Integration in your repository (with ReadMe badge).
6.Integrate test coverage reporting (e.g. Coveralls) with badge in the ReadMe.
7.Obtain CI badges (e.g. from Code Climate and Coveralls) and add to ReadMe.
8.Ensure the app gets hosted on Heroku.
